This project uses two APIs:
1) https://rapidapi.com/accujazz/api/rawg-video-games-database
2) https://rapidapi.com/h0p3rwe/api/youtube-search-and-download
 
Process:
- User types in Game title in Search Bar, Video Game Data Database returns result (information about game)
- Button appears below information that says 'get OST'
- When user clicks this button, YouTube searcher will search for a playlist (takes title, and adds 'OST')
- Returns results below

# TODO:
- Only pull up the YouTube playlist if a button is pressed
- Add redirect support for the RawG database search
