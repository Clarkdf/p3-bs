This project uses two APIs:
1) https://rapidapi.com/accujazz/api/rawg-video-games-database (special dev key = 0b81130b95524eb6bb292ae0911635a8)
2) https://rapidapi.com/h0p3rwe/api/youtube-search-and-download
 
Process:
- User types in Game title in Search Bar, Video Game Data Database returns result (information about game)
- Button appears below information that says 'get OST'
- When user clicks this button, YouTube searcher will search for a playlist (takes title, and adds 'OST')
- Returns results below
