            <h3>This website works is as follows:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>User enters website</li>
                <li>User searches for a video game (or game franchise) in the search bar</li>
                <li>Website connects to RAWG video game database and searches for games (picks at most 25)</li>
                <li>The search results are displayed as buttons</li>
                <li>User presses button, site reconnects with the rawG database, pulls, and displays information about
                    the game</li>
                <li>Website saves the game's title</li>
                <li>Website connects to the YouTube search API and uses the title to search for the game's soundtrack
                </li>
                <li>Website pulls the first result from the search API and embeds it on the bottom of the page</li>
                <li>Refresh the page to start over</li>

            <h3>Future improvements</h3>
            <p>I really liked this project and want to continue working on it after this class. I've thought of some
                future improvements to the site that are out of scope for this project</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Improve UI and site's appearance</li>
                <li>Not having to refresh the site to enter in another game</li>
                <li>Adding more interactive type media. Allowing player to cycle through screenshots for example</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I would ahve liked to add these features, but they are past the project's requirements, and I don't have
                the time at the moment</p>
