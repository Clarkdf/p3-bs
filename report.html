            <h3>This website works is as follows:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>User enters website</li>
                <li>User searches for a video game (or game franchise) in the search bar</li>
                <li>Website connects to RAWG video game database and searches for games (picks at most 25)</li>
                <li>The search results are displayed as buttons</li>
                <li>User presses button, site reconnects with the rawG database, pulls, and displays information about
                    the game</li>
                <li>Website saves the game's title</li>
                <li>Website connects to the YouTube search API and uses the title to search for the game's soundtrack
                </li>
                <li>Website pulls the first result from the search API and embeds it on the bottom of the page</li>
                <li>Refresh the page to start over</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="website-requirements">
            <h3>Website meets Project requirements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Site is Deployed <a href="https://clarkdf.github.io/p3-bs/">here</a></li>
                <li>Website has css and changes depending on screen size. Specifically, the buttons go from
                    row-direction to column direction</li>
                <li>Uses the following APIs:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://rapidapi.com/accujazz/api/rawg-video-games-database">RAWG Video Game
                                Database</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://rapidapi.com/h0p3rwe/api/youtube-search-and-download">YouTube Video
                                Searcher</a></li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Implemented Search (Searches RAWG database for video games)</li>
            <li>Displays results from search (At most 25 search results from the database)</li>
            <li>Results are filterable: press a button ot pick the exact game you want</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="recommended-games">
            <h3>Recommended games</h3>
            <p>There are many video games with various popularity/notariety. Not every game in the database. Not every
                soundtrack is easily found on YouTube. Thus, I'm providing a list of games to try</p>
            <p>The Database contains games that were not legitimately published (fan games for example). I was able to
                filter out some (but not all)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>spec-ops (the line)</li>
                <li>Mario Bros</li>
                <li>Mario World</li>
                <li>Yoshi</li>
                <li>Wii</li>
                <li>Zelda</li>

            <h3>Future improvements</h3>
            <p>I really liked this project and want to continue working on it after this class. I've thought of some
                future improvements to the site that are out of scope for this project</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Improve UI and site's appearance</li>
                <li>Not having to refresh the site to enter in another game</li>
                <li>Adding more interactive type media. Allowing player to cycle through screenshots for example</li>
                <li>More robust YouTube search. Since it just takes the first result, it doesn't always get the right
                    game. </li>
                <li>Filter out some of RAWG's unofficial games</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I would have liked to add these features, but they are past the project's requirements, and I don't have
                the time at the moment</p>
